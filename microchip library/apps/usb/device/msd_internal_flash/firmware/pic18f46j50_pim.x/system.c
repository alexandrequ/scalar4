//	The USB specifications require that USB peripheral devices must never source

//	current on D+ or D- when the host/hub is not actively powering the Vbus line.
//	When designing a self powered (as opposed to bus powered) USB peripheral
//	device, the firmware should make sure not to turn on the USB module and D+
//	or D- pull up resistor unless Vbus is actively powered.  Therefore, the
//	firmware needs some means to detect when Vbus is being powered by the host.
//	A 5V tolerant I/O pin can be connected to Vbus (through a resistor), and
// 	can be used to detect when Vbus is high (host actively powering), or low
//	(host is shut down or otherwise not supplying power).  The USB firmware
// 	can then periodically poll this I/O pin to know when it is okay to turn on
//	the USB module/D+/D- pull up resistor.  When designing a purely bus powered
//	peripheral device, it is not possible to source current on D+ or D- when the
//	host is not actively providing power on Vbus. Therefore, implementing this
//	bus sense feature is optional.  This firmware can be made to use this bus
//	sense feature by making sure "USE_USB_BUS_SENSE_IO" has been defined in the
//	HardwareProfile.h file.

//	self and bus powered, it should not return a hard coded value for this request.
//	Instead, firmware should check if it is currently self or bus powered, and
//	respond accordingly.  If the hardware has been configured like demonstrated
//	on the PICDEM FS USB Demo Board, an I/O pin can be polled to determine the
//	currently selected power source.  On the PICDEM FS USB Demo Board, "RA2"
//	is used for	this purpose.  If using this feature, make sure "USE_SELF_POWER_SENSE_IO"

    //If the microcontroller is "overclocked" (ex: by running at maximum rated
    //frequency, but then not suppling enough voltage to meet the datasheet
    //voltage vs. frequency graph), errant code execution could occur.  It is
    //therefore strongly recommended to check the voltage prior to performing a 
    //flash self erase/write unlock sequence.  If the voltage is too low to meet
    //the voltage vs. frequency graph in the datasheet, the firmware should not 
    //initiate a self erase/program operation, and instead it should either:
    //1.  Clock switch to a lower frequency that does meet the voltage/frequency graph.  Or,
    //2.  Put the microcontroller to Sleep mode.
    
    //The method used to measure Vdd and/or Vddcore will depend upon the 
    //microcontroller model and the module features available in the device, but
    //several options are available on many of the microcontrollers, ex:
    //1.  HLVD module
    //2.  WDTCON<LVDSTAT> indicator bit
    //3.  Perform ADC operation, with the VBG channel selected, using Vdd/Vss as 
    //      references to the ADC.  Then perform math operations to calculate the Vdd.
    //      On some micros, the ADC can also measure the Vddcore voltage, allowing
    //      the firmware to calculate the absolute Vddcore voltage, if it has already
    //      calculated and knows the ADC reference voltage.
    //4.  Use integrated general purpose comparator(s) to sense Vdd/Vddcore voltage
    //      is above proper threshold.
    //5.  If the micrcontroller implements a user adjustable BOR circuit, enable
    //      it and set the trip point high enough to avoid overclocking altogether.
