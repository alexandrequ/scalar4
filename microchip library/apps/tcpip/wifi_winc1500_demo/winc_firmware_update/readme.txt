
This tool updates the WINC1500 firmware to version 19_5_2_rc7.  

Install the package at a high-level directory (e.g. C:\winc1500); do not install at the default location of
C:\Program Files (x86)\...  as the directory paths will be too long.

After installation, refer to the 'How to Download New WINC1500 Firmware' section in the 
'WINC1500 MLA Getting Started Guide' document.
